      <h1><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h1>
      <p>The MESA Down Under summer school is an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, body size, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is a policy of MESA Down Under that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. <br><br>All participants must agree to the code of conduct when applying to attend MESA Down Under. This policy applies to all participants of this summer school, including lecturers and teaching assistants. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.<br><br>We ask that all participants follow the following expected standard behaviour:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Do be professional, considerate, respectful and collaborative when interacting with your colleagues</li>
        <li>Do not create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for any of the participants</li>
        <li>Do not engage in physical or verbal abuse of anyone</li>
        <li>Do not engage in harassment, intimidation of discrimination in any form</li>
        <li>Do not insult or put down other participants. Critique ideas rather than individuals</li>
        <li>Do speak up if you witness unacceptable behaviour and/or report it afterward</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Individuals engaging in behaviour prohibited by this policy will be subject to disciplinary action at the sole discretion of the organisers, which may include verbal warnings, being asked to leave the school without a refund of any charge and the reporting of behaviour to their employer. Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour from the organisers are expected to comply immediately. <br><br>‍<strong>Reporting an Incident<br>‍</strong>Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is encouraged to speak, in confidence, to the LOC in person or by email (mesadownunder@sydney.edu.au). All complaints will be treated seriously and be investigated promptly. Confidentiality will be honoured to the extent permitted as long as the rights of others are not compromised. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate behaviour will not be tolerated.<br><br>‍<strong>Definition of Retaliation<br>‍</strong>Retaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment.<br><br>‍<strong>Definition of Sexual Harassment<br>‍</strong>Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behaviour and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person may be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behaviour.<br><br>Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behaviour that is unwelcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behaviour that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching. <br><br>‍<strong>Definition of Other Harassment<br>‍</strong>Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.<br><br>‍<strong>Definition of Discrimination<br>‍</strong>Discrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practised commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person’s competence or suitability.</p>
